# ENHANCHED-DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION
The Enhanced Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System is a real-time safety project that uses a deep learning CNN model for eye state classification and computer vision for eye detection. It monitors eye activity to detect fatigue or drowsiness ,triggering an alarm to alert drivers and prevent accidents.

FEATURES:

1.Real-time eye monitoring using webcam

2.Deep learning CNN model for eye state classification

3.Computer vision (Haar Cascades) for eye detection

4.Alarm sound alert when drowsiness is detected

5.Lightweight and easy to run on most systems


HOW IT WORKS

1.Captures live video from the webcam.

2.Detects face and eyes using Haar Cascades.

3.Classifies eye state (open/closed) using the CNN model.

4.Triggers an alarm if eyes remain closed beyond a threshold.

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pygame, Matplotlib
